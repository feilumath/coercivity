  abstract = {We consider a system of finite number of particles that are moving in              
              under mutual interaction. It is assumed that the particles are subjected to some 
additional random forces which cause diffusion motion of the particles. The latter is described by a system of stochastic differential equations of the first order 
for noninertia particles and the second order for inertial particles. The coefficient of the system are unbounded because the interaction force tends to infinity 
if the distance between two particles tends to zero. The system is called regular 
if no particle can hit the other. We investigate conditions of regularity.  This article is dedicated to the memory of Roland L. Dobrushin.},

  abstract = {We prove strong Feller properties for a class of distorted Brownian motions on d. We also construct a weak solution to the corresponding stochastic differential equation starting from any point in \{ = 0\} and staying in \{ = 0\} before possibly going out of any ball in d. Here is the Lebesgue density of the symmetrizing measure {$\mathrm{\mu}$}. Our condition on the logarithmic derivative {$\nabla$} is that it should be locally in Ld+{$\epsilon$}, but only with respect to the symmetrizing measure {$\mathrm{\mu}$} = dx, not necessarily Lebesgue measure dx. This allows applications to singular situations. In particular, finite particle systems with two body interactions with infinitely strong repulsion can be treated by our results. Among other things it is shown that they never meet no matter what their starting configuration was. Another application treats diffusions in random media.},
