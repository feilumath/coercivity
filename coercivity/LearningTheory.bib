	Abstract = {We consider the linear span S of the functions tak (with some ak>0) in weighted L2 spaces, with rather general weights. We give one necessary and one sufficient condition for S to be dense. Some comparisons are also made between the new results and those that can be deduced from older ones in the literature.},
