	abstract = {We investigate the approximate dynamics of several differential equations when the solutions are restricted to a sparse subset of a given basis. The restriction is enforced at every time step by simply applying soft thresholding to the coefficients of the basis approximation. By reducing or compressing the information needed to represent the solution at every step, only the essential dynamics are represented. In many cases, there are natural bases derived from the differential equations, which promote sparsity. We find that our method successfully reduces the dynamics of convection equations, diffusion equations, weak shocks, and vorticity equations with high-frequency source terms.},

abstract="The classical inverse statistical mechanics question involves inferring properties of pairwise interaction potentials from exhibited ground states. For patterns that concentrate near a sphere, the ground states can range from platonic solids for small numbers of particles to large systems of particles exhibiting very complex structures. In this setting, previous work (von Brecht et al., Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 22, 2012) allows us to infer that the linear instabilities of the pairwise potential accurately characterize the resulting nonlinear ground states. Potentials with a small number of spherical harmonic instabilities may produce very complex patterns as a result. This leads naturally to the linearized inverse statistical mechanics question: given a finite set of unstable modes, can we construct a potential that possesses precisely these linear instabilities? If so, this would allow for the design of potentials with arbitrarily intricate spherical symmetries in the ground state. In this paper, we solve our linearized inverse problem in full, and present a wide variety of designed ground states.",

As a basis, an existing agent-based model is used for contagion of emotions, beliefs and intentions. From available video material and witness reports, useful empirical data were extracted. Similar patterns were achieved in simulations, whereby some of the parameters of the model were tuned to the case addressed, and most parameters were assigned default values. The results show the inclusion of contagion of belief, emotion, and intention states of agents results in better reproduction of the incident than non-inclusion.",

abstract ={Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},
